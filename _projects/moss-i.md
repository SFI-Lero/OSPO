# MOSS-I
The Managing Open Source Software in Irish Universities [MOSS-I] project is funded by the Irelandâ€™s National Open Research Forum (NORF) Open Research Fund 2023. The project was awarded to the project lead, Dr. Patrick Healy, Lero SFI Research Centre, University of Limerick under strand three.

The MOSS-I project aims to develop a clear framework dedicated to guiding users in the research and academic community on the uses of Open Source Software (OSS). The framework will focus on:

- Creating awareness for users about the background and uses of Open Source Software.
- Explaining the various types of OSS licences.
- Highlighting the potential impacts and considerations for using OSS effectively with guidance from the Technology Transfer Office (TTO) in Ireland.

It is designed to promote uniformity in advice provided by Irish universities; this framework will serve as a reliable resource for understanding, consuming, contributing to, and creating OSS. It will support the Irish research system to strengthen, promote or better support open source practices within open research practices. It will incorporate guides and references from globally recognised university sources, who offer in-depth knowledge about OSS principles, practices, processes, and tools, all contextualised within an Irish framework.
