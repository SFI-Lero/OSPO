detailed_description: "We are excited to invite you all to the World of Code Hackathon, due to take place between October 7-9. The creator of the World of Code dataset/tool, Dr. Audris Mockus, will be visiting Ireland for organizing the hackathon. The event is open to students at all levels, postdocs, faculties, and everyone else who is interested. Participants in previous events include faculty members in various universities including CMU, University of Auckland (New Zealand), and employees of companies like GitHub. All you need is basic knowledge of some shell commands and/or Python. As an additional incentive for participation, World of Code is featured in the 'mining challenge' track of the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference, 2023. So, the participants will have a higher chance of being able to publish the work they do in the hackathon in this track. See details - <https://conf.researchr.org/track/msr-2023/msr-2023-mining-challenge#Call-for-Mining-Challenge-Papers>. Please fill out this form so that we know you are interested: <https://forms.gle/u1B9wC2jHoNHoHKDA>. See more details on World of Code - <https://worldofcode.org/>."
